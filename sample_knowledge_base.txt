# Sample Sales Playbook

## Product Overview

Our platform is a cutting-edge AI-powered sales analysis tool designed to help sales professionals close more deals by understanding customer intent and objections in real-time.

## Common Objections and Responses

### "It's too expensive"
**Response Strategy:**
- Focus on ROI: Show how the tool increases close rates by 30-40%
- Break down cost per deal closed
- Offer flexible payment plans
- Emphasize the cost of NOT using the tool (lost deals)

### "I need to think about it"
**Response Strategy:**
- This usually means they have an unspoken objection
- Ask: "What specifically would you like to think about?"
- Identify the real concern and address it directly
- Create urgency with limited-time offers or bonuses

### "We're already using another solution"
**Response Strategy:**
- Don't attack the competition
- Ask what they like/dislike about current solution
- Position as complementary, not replacement
- Highlight unique features (AI analysis, real-time insights)

## Buying Signals to Watch For

1. **Time Investment**: When prospects spend significant time asking detailed questions
2. **Future Talk**: "When we implement this..." instead of "If"
3. **Budget Discussions**: Asking about pricing, payment options
4. **Stakeholder Involvement**: Bringing in decision-makers or team members
5. **Implementation Questions**: "How long does setup take?"

## Red Flags / Deal Killers

- Vague responses to direct questions
- Consistent rescheduling
- No budget allocated
- No clear decision-maker identified
- "Just browsing" mentality

## Closing Strategies

### Assumptive Close
Proceed as if the deal is already done
- "I'll send you the onboarding link..."
- "Your account will be ready by..."

### Alternative Close
Give two options, both leading to a close
- "Would you prefer monthly or annual billing?"
- "Should we start with the Pro or Enterprise plan?"

### Urgency Close
Create legitimate time pressure
- Limited-time discount
- Bonus features for early adopters
- Price increase announcement
